Our daily presence in the camp has allowed us to build relationships with the now largely static population of refugees on Samos. Upon arrival, they must settle into the semi-closed camp to await the long-drawn out asylum procedure: this can take months, and in some cases, years. Recently, we came out of a transitional period during which we moved our activities from the daily distribution of non-food items, to informal educational activities and psycho-social support. We feel that the clothing and hygiene needs of those residing in the camp can be covered by the government organisations mandated to provide this support, and so we feel we can have a bigger impact on our beneficiaries through means of education, activities, and interesting projects and courses.",
