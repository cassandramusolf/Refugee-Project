<h1>Refugee Family Child Care</h1>
<h3>Program Goal</h3>
<p>
The Refugee Family Child Care Microenterprise Development Program provides business opportunities to refugee women in a market where there is a shortage of childcare providers. Through the grant, mentors will help refugee women establish agreements or contracts with state or county child care offices so they may qualify for state/county childcare reimbursement as childcare service providers, and become successful, independent entrepreneurs.
</p>
<p>
in FY2012, ORR increased funding to the program, raising it from $2.225 million to $5,752 million, and offering grants to a total of 34 agencies.
</p>
<p>
During the first year of the project, the original 13 grantees have collectively:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled 879 refugee women in the program;</li>
<li>Trained 745 refugees;</li>
<li>Helped 172 refugees obtain business licenses;</li>
<li>Assisted 160 refugees to start home based child care programs</li>
<li>Created 1,061 childcare slots for children;</li>
<li>Paid $249,000 in grants to partially cover business startup costs, and assisted the home based child care owners to obtain an additional $208,000 in subsidies;</li>
<li>Helped 207 refugees find and secure jobs, and</li>
<li>Taken 79 refugees off public assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eligible Applicants</h3>
<p>
Public or private non profit organizations are eligible for these grants.
</p>
<h3>Targeted Populations</h3>
<p>
Eligibility includes persons who meet all requirements of 45 CFR 400.43 (as amended by 65 FR 154009 (March 22, 2000).
</p>
<p>
All low income refugees who are not citizens are eligible for services under this program. Women refugees who arrived in the U.S. within the last five years at the time of enrollment are given priority for services under this program.

          <h4>Children in Syria</h4>
          <p>2016 was the worst year yet for Syria's children as violence ripped apart places that should be safe, schools, hospitals, playgrounds, parks and children's own homes. 8.4 million Syrian children, inside and outside the country, are in need of humanitarian aid, and millions have borne witness to unrelenting violence from the brutal conflict.</p>

          <p>Children and adolescents often have higher levels with various investigations revealing rates of PTSD from 50-90% and major depression from 6-40%. Risk factors for the development of mental health problems include the number of traumas, delayed asylum application process, detention, and the loss of culture and support systems.</p>

          <p>Syrians fled their homes in order to avoid the poverty and fighting that they had been facing, but since the countries they fled to are not equipped to deal with such a large refugee population, many Syrians end up suffering even after they escape the war zone. Syrian refugees have limited access to food, clean water and healthcare causing an increase in diseases, malnutrition and other health issues.</p>
