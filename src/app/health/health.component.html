      <!-- <h3>Malnutrition</h3>
      <p>Malnutrition is a major issue among Syrian refugees. They are living in poverty whether they are displaced in their country or in an asylum country. With poverty comes lack of food and clean water.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Syrians fled their homes in order to avoid the poverty and fighting that they had been facing, but since the countries they fled to are not equipped to deal with such a large refugee population, many Syrians end up suffering even after they escape the war zone.</p>
      <p>Syrian refugees have limited access to food, clean water and healthcare causing an increase in diseases, malnutrition and other health issues.</p>
      <p>Most of the babies born to women refugees are under six pounds and there is a lack of breastmilk production because the mothers are malnutritioned.</p> -->

    <br>

    <li>With RMA, the refugee gets the same benefits package as a Medicaid recipient in that state.</li>

<p>"Refugees are eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but they still face plenty of obstacles to receiving proper care. In cities across the U.S., refugee agencies work locally to remove some of these barriers to health care. Former refugees help newly-arrived ones to get their feet on the ground, but they also hope to go beyond the basics, offering specialized mental health services and programs for survivors of torture to heal the wounds of war." - Medical Daily</p>

<h3>Interpreter Services</h3>
It is essential that health care and related services are provided in a language and manner that the refugee can understand. Federal laws, such as Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, require federal agencies to implement systems to help those with limited English proficiency. In addition, some states have passed laws requiring competent medical interpreters in all hospital and mental health emergency rooms.

<p>"Our vision is a world in which refugee and internally displaced women, children and youth:
are safe, healthy and self-reliant;
have their human rights respected and protected;
and inform and drive their own solutions and development."</p>


<h5></h5>
<p>We are a group of  students who attend medical school at Michigan State and we are passionate about helping to alleviate some of the challenges that have arisen from the humanitarian crisis caused by the Syrian Civil War.<br>

Our mission is simple: Provide health education to Syrian refugee women, designed to  empower the women to become self-sufficient, health-care advocates in their new homes.</p>


<h3>Mental Health</h3>
<p>Mental health is a big priority when it comes to refugees seeking helath care. They have been a part of a conflict that has affected, and may continue to affect, their everyday well being. A large majority of Syrian refugees are children. Post traumatic stress disorder is the most common health issue facing children. Many children are severely traumatized with symptoms of depression, withdrawl, regression, chronic anxiety, panic attacks, nightmares, and obsessive, compulsive, and reactive behaviors. In order to prevent further trauma mental healthcare is neccessary.</p>
<p>Children and adolescents often have higher levels with various investigations revealing rates of PTSD from 50-90% and major depression from 6-40%. Risk factors for the development of mental health problems include the number of traumas, delayed asylum application process, detention, and the loss of culture and support systems.</p>
