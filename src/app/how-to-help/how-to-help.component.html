  In Lebanon, life is a daily struggle for many Syrian refugees, who have little or no financial resources. Around 70 per cent live below the poverty line on less than USD 3.84 per person per day. There are no formal refugee camps and, as a result, more than a million registered Syrians are scattered throughout more than 2,100 urban and rural communities and locations, often sharing small basic lodgings with other refugee families in overcrowded conditions.

          Finances: Many refugees state that it can be difficult to find jobs and legal ways to make a living, usually accepting low pay in order to provide resources for their families to survive. Shelter is hard to come by and many families live without heat or running water.
          Sanitation: lack of clean water and sanitation in crowded locations allows for diseases like cholera and polio to spread.</h4>
