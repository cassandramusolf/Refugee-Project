  <h4 class="quote">“We are exhausted, and there are not many of us left, but we continue our 20-hour shifts. What is most heartbreaking is when we have to choose which patients to save because there aren’t enough doctors to treat everyone. Our hospitals, though they are the targets of bombs, still overflow with the sick and injured.”</h4>

      <h3>"Each year, millions of people, particularly women and children, die from preventable causes in countries affected by violent conflict and natural disasters. Most of these deaths are the result of disruptions related to crisis: poor sanitation, shortages of food and medicine, and inadequate prevention. Refugees resettled in the United States also can face difficulties accessing proper health care." -International Rescue Committee

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>
  The 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by its 1967 protocol defines a refugee as a person who "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country..."
</p>

<h2>Government</h2>

 The State Department receives $340 million from Congress for resettlement programs and $1.7 billion for humanitarian assistance overseas

 <p>
   the federal government provides transitional resettlement assistance to newly arrived refugees. In the first 90 days, agencies contract with the Department of State to provide for refugee's food, housing, employment, medical care, counseling and other services to help the refugee make a rapid transition to economic self-sufficiency.
