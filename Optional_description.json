Syrians are arriving in these countries with few assets, limited livelihood opportunities and little cash; families are becoming increasingly dependent on humanitarian assistance. Joint needs assessments of displaced Syrians in these neighbouring countries showed that food is a top priority. To respond to these urgent food needs, WFP launched a Regional Refugee Emergency Operation that provides food assistance as part of a broader framework of support to refugees under the leadership of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). WFP supports strong partnerships with Governments, United Nations organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), and is aligned with the United Nations Syria Regional Response Plan/s. WFPs Regional Emergency Operation to cover the food needs of refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries was launched in July 2012 (and February 2013 in Egypt). To date, WFP has assisted almost 1.2 million refugees, nearly 90 percent of whom were assisted through a food voucher programme. WFP plans to reach 2.6 million refugees by the end of 2013.

For the first two years care was provided at the International Clinic of St. Paul Ramsey Medical Center. In 1987 we moved to a more home-like and less institutional setting that would feel welcoming to survivors. Today CVT provides care from our St. Paul Healing Center. The house was designed to meet the needs of torture survivors, with domestic furnishings, large windows and rooms with rounded or angled corners to create an environment much different from the stark square rooms with glaring lights that most torture survivors experienced."
