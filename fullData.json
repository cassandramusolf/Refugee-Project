Recently, we came out of a transitional period during which we moved our activities from the daily distribution of non-food items, to informaleducational activities and psycho-social support. We feel that the clothing and hygiene needs of those residing in the camp can be covered by the government organisations mandated to provide this support, and so we feel we can have a bigger impact on our beneficiaries through means ofeducation, activities, and interesting projects and courses."
